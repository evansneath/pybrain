This repository has been forked for the purpose of bug fixing and
customization during the use of PyBrain for robotic neural network
research.

Quick answer: make sure you have SciPy installed, then run
```python setup.py install```
	
Longer answer: (if the above was any trouble) we keep more
detailed installation instructions (including those
for the dependencies) up-to-date in the [Wiki]
(http://wiki.github.com/pybrain/pybrain/installation).
