FORK NOTES
----------
This repository has been forked for the purpose of bug fixing and
customization during the use of PyBrain for robotic neural network
research.


INSTALLATION
------------
Quick answer: make sure you have SciPy installed, then run
```python setup.py install```
	
Longer answer: (if the above was any trouble) we keep more
detailed installation instructions (including those
for the dependencies) up-to-date in the [Wiki]
(http://wiki.github.com/pybrain/pybrain/installation).


DOCUMENTATION

Please read ```docs/documentation.pdf``` or browse ```docs/html/*```
featuring: quickstart, tutorials, API, etc.

If you have matplotlib, the scripts in ```examples/*``` may be instructive
as well.
